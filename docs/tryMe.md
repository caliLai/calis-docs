Oh man, I sure hope this doesn't have to be professional.

## A Quote? Who would've thought

Y'know, I never actively browsed through quotes to look for that one "inspirational quote" to live my life by, but I think 
Winston Churchill has some [solid comebacks](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/winston_churchill_108948):
> I may be drunk, Miss, but in the morning I will be sober and you will still be ugly.

---
The rest of the quotes I (moderately) enjoy are just really stupid ones under the 
[funny](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/eddie_izzard_128987?src=t_funny) section. Eddie Izzard makes a great point:
> Never put a sock in a toaster.

## Mom, can we keep it?
Did you know that I am unable to hold small dogs because they always move around too much and make me ticklish? Anyways 
so uh yeah I love big fluffy dogs.

### Conciseness Helps Web Readers
If I'm hopping onto the World Wide Web to read something, you'd best bet that I expect things to be easy to read. Otherwise, 
I could've gotten a book had I more time.

Let's simplify some sentences:
> At this point in time we can’t ascertain the reason as to why the screen door was left open.

`Right now, we can't be sure of why the screen door was left open.`

> There is a desire on the part of many of us to maintain a spring break for the purpose of getting away from the demands of our studies.

`A lot of us want to have a spring break so we can relax from school.`

## Code Blocks Make Me Happy
Sometimes documentation actually confuses people. My guildmate had some trouble getting a repsonse from an API so I sent 
him a snippet of code in Python that helped him:
```py
import requests

r = requests.post(url, data = {'api_key':API_KEY})
print(r.json())
```
Here's a piece of PHP that grabs code from another file. You might need it for
deployment:
```php
<?php include_once("index.html"); ?>
```

**Time for me to head out**
